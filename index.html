        Oscar. I don't
        have
        a website
        right now, but if you check back in a while, nothing might have
        changed. I don't know the answer today, but it is up to me. My hands are tied and there's literally a lot I can
        do about it. I'm sorry. Just remember this: and that's it. If you forget, the next moment that very thing would
        have been forgotten. And thank and a to you. <br />Ok this is stupid, bye.</h1>
